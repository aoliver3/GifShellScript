# GifShellScript

A long time ago in a galaxy far,

far away...

Students had to find each gif they wanted to download,

one...

by one...

by one!

Tired of downloading gifs one at a time?

**Well get a load of this multi gif downloading script!!!**

* All content downloaded through [Giphy.com](http://www.giphy.com)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions
 * Run the gifscript.sh
 * When prompted, provide a single word answer for the types of gifs you want to download
 * After the script has located gifs for download, tell it how many you want with the max being 25
 * The script will create a gif_"YOUR INPUT" folder to stash your gifs in
